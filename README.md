# Registration Form
- "I've implemented a user-friendly registration form in my e-commerce web application using ReactJS and Spring Boot. The registration form, powered by the react-hook-form package, handles errors gracefully, preventing navigation to the home page if users input incorrect details. On the backend, I've developed register APIs, integrated with SendGrid for email alerts. The application ensures a secure login process by validating user credentials against the MySQL database, allowing successful logins to navigate to the home page."

# Home page
- 
"I've enhanced the homepage of my e-commerce application by incorporating static images and implementing a dynamic carousel using a package. Utilizing the card component within the carousel, I efficiently displayed an array of objects containing image names, descriptions, ratings, and prices, utilizing the map method for seamless iteration."

# Product management
- "I've implemented a comprehensive product management system in my ReactJS project, integrating Spring Boot APIs for seamless data flow. Utilizing the useState hook, I efficiently update the React DOM structure. In the Spring Boot backend, I've configured model entities for product attributes like name, price, rating, description, image, and thumbnails. These entities are stored in a MySQL database, and I've utilized the axios package to connect and fetch data between the ReactJS frontend and Spring Boot backend. Displaying the backend data on the frontend is achieved through the useEffect hook and the map method, rendering each product's details with tags corresponding to the model entity attributes."

# Cart Implementation

Leveraging ReactJS and Spring Boot, this addition enhances the overall functionality, ensuring users have a clear overview and management of their selected items in the shopping cart."
